title: JS/TS APIs
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

On startup TrailBase will automatically load any JavaScript and TypeScript
files in `traildepot/scripts`.
This can be used to implement arbitrary HTTP APIs using custom handlers.

## Example HTTP Endpoint

The following example illustrates a few things:

* How to register a parameterized route with `{table}`.
* How to implement a handler that returns `text/plain` content. There is also
  `jsonHandler` and `htmlHandler`.
* How to query the database.
* How to return an error.

```js
// FIXME: WASM RUNTIME
import {
  addRoute,
  query,
  stringHandler,
  HttpError,
  StatusCodes
} from "../trailbase.js";

addRoute("GET", "/test/{table}", stringHandler(async (req) => {
  const table = req.params["table"];
  if (table) {
    const rows = await query(`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ${table}`, [])
    return `entries: ${rows[0][0]}`;
  }

  throw new HttpError(
      StatusCodes.BAD_REQUEST, "Missing '?table=' search query param");
}));
```

More examples can be found in the repository in
`client/testfixture/scripts/index.ts`.

## Runtime Details

At its heart, TrailBase's runtime is a pool of V8 worker threads - called
*isolates* - alongside a runtime that supports basic tasks such as file I/O, web
requests, timers, etc.
While it uses Deno's V8-integration under the hood, it is *not* a full Node.js
runtime, at least for now.

<Aside type="note" title="State Sharing">
  Different *isolates* do not share state, i.e. you cannot use global state to
  reliably share state across requests. Instead, state can be persisted using
  the database.
